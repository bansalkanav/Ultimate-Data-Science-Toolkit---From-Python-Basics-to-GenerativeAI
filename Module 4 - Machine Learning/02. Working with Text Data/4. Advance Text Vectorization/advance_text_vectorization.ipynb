    "    - Distributed Representation\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Text Vectorization**\n",
    "Text vectorization is a way to represent words or phrases as vectors in a high-dimensional space based on their contextual meaning within a corpus of text data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The idea is that if two phrases are similar then the vectors that represent those phrases should be close together and vice versa.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Feature Extraction is an important step for any machine learning problem.\n",
    "2. No matter how good a modeling algorithm you use, if you feed in poor features, you will get poor results.\n",
    "3. **Remember:** \"Garbage in, garbage out.\"\n",
    "4. Data can be text, images, videos, or speech.\n",
    "5. Mathematically representing images, videos and speech is straightforward.\n",
    "6. However, feature representation for text is often much more involved as compared to other formats of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Various Feature Representation Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Basic Vectorization Approaches (Eg: BoW and TF IDF)\n",
    "2. Distributed Representation (Eg: Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText)\n",
    "3. Universal Language Representation (Eg: GPT, BERT, etc...)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **a. Basic Vectorization Approaches**\n",
    "- Eg: One-Hot Encoding, Bag of Words, Bag of N-Grams, and TFIDF\n",
    "- **Drawbacks:** They are discrete representations, vector representation is sparse and high-dimensional, and they cannot handle OOV words.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **b. Distributed Representation**\n",
    "- Eg: Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, fastText), Document Embeddings (Doc2Vec)\n",
    "- Text embeddings are a way to represent words or phrases as vectors in a high-dimensional space based on their semantic meaning within a corpus of text data. The idea is that if two phrases are similar then the vectors that represent those phrases should be close together and vice versa.\n",
    "- Word2Vec don't have a good way of handling OOV words\n",
    "- **Handling OOV words Problem:** One way is by modifying the training process by bringing in characters and other sub-level linguistic components such as morphological properties (e.g., prefixes, suffixes, word endings, etc...). **FastText** from facebook follows this approach.\n",
    "- **Drawbacks:** Above techniques only provide word embeddings. Inorder to get document embedding, we can aggregate the word embeddings to get document embeddings. But, for sentences \"dog bites man\" and \"man bites dog\", both will receive same representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **c. Universal Language Representation**\n",
    "- Problem in the above approach: One word gets one fixed representation. Eg: \"I went to bank to withdraw money\" and \"I sat on the river bank\" both uses the word \"bank\"\n",
    "- Examples of Universal Language Representation: GPT, BERT, etc... \n",
    "- **Key Idea:** Learn embedding on a generic task like **Language Modeling** on a massive corpus and then fine-tune learnings on a task-specific data. This is also known as **transfer learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Latent Space**\n",
    "A latent space, also known as a latent feature space or embedding space, is an embedding of a set of items within a manifold in which items which resemble each other more closely are positioned closer to one another in the latent space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Word Embedding**\n",
    "In natural language processing (NLP), [word embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding) is a term used for the representation of words for text analysis, typically in the form of a real-valued vector that encodes the meaning of the word such that the words that are closer in the vector space are expected to be similar in meaning. Word embeddings can be obtained using a set of [language modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model) and [feature learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_learning) techniques where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods to generate this mapping include **neural networks**, **dimensionality reduction on the word co-occurrence matrix**, **probabilistic models**, **explainable knowledge base method**, and **explicit representation in terms of the context in which words appear**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, one of the main **limitations of word embeddings** (word vector space models in general) is that words with multiple meanings are conflated into a single representation (a single vector in the semantic space). In other words, [polysemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysemy) and [homonymy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homonym) are not handled properly. \n"

    "\n",
    "**Embeddings**  \n",
    "Word2Vec offers pre-trained word embeddings that anyone can use off-the-shelf. The embeddings are key: value pairs, essentially 1-1 mappings between words and their respective vectors. Word2Vec takes a single word as input and outputs a single vector representation of that word. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since BERT generates contextual embeddings, it takes as input a sequence (usually a sentence) rather than a single word. BERT needs to be shown the context that surrounding words provide before it can generate a word embedding. With BERT, you do need to have the actual model as the vector representations of words will vary based on the specific sequences you’re inputting. The output is a fixed-length vector representation of the input sentence. \n",
    "\n",
    "BERT or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a technique that allows for bidirectional training of Transformers for natural language modeling tasks. Language models which are bidirectionally trained can learn deeper context from language than single-direction models. BERT generates context aware embeddings that allow for multiple representations (each representation, in this case, is a vector) of each word based on a given word’s context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word Ordering**  \n",
    "Word2Vec embeddings do not take into account the word position.\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT model explicitly takes as input the position (index) of each word in the sentence before calculating its embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Out-of-Vocabulary**  \n",
    "Since Word2Vec learns embeddings at word level, it can only generate embeddings for words that existed in it’s training set (aka it’s “vocabulary space”). This is a major drawback to Word2Vec - that it just doesn’t support Out-of-Vocabulary words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, BERT learns representations at the subword level, so a BERT model will have a smaller vocabulary space than the number of unique words in its training corpus. In turn, BERT is able to generate embeddings for words outside of its vocabulary space giving it a near infinite vocabulary. \n",

    "**BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) has set a new state-of-the-art performance on sentence-pair regression tasks like semantic textual similarity (STS). However, it requires that both sentences are fed into the network, which causes a massive computational overhead: Finding the most similar pair in a collection of 10,000 sentences requires about 50 million inference computations (~65 hours) with BERT. The construction of BERT makes it unsuitable for semantic similarity search as well as for unsupervised tasks like clustering.**\n",

This reduces the effort for finding the most similar pair from 65 hours with BERT / RoBERTa to about 5 seconds with SBERT, while maintaining the accuracy from BERT.**\n",
